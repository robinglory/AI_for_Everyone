Manufacturer	Engineered Arts
Year of creation	2021; 4 years ago
Type	Humanoid
Purpose	Human interaction
Ameca is a female robotic humanoid created in 2021 by Engineered Arts.

History
The first generation of Ameca was developed at Engineered Arts headquarters in Falmouth, Cornwall, United Kingdom. The project started in February 2021, with the first video revealed publicly on 1 December 2021.[1] Ameca gained widespread attention on Twitter[2] and TikTok[3] ahead of her first public demonstration at the Consumer Electronics Show 2022, where she was covered by CNET[4] and other news outlets.[5][6][7]

In 2022, Ameca presented an Alternative Christmas message by British TV Channel 4 for Christmas Day.[8] Ameca was associated with the Museum of the Future's robotic family, where she could interact with visitors.[9] In 2024, Ameca was moved to Edinburgh in the UK to reside at the National Robotarium.[10]

Features
It is designed as a platform for further developing robotics technologies involving human-robot interaction.[11] utilizes embedded microphones, binocular eye mounted cameras, a chest camera and facial recognition software to interact with the public. Interactions can be governed by either OpenAI's GPT-3 or human telepresence. She also features articulated motorized arms, fingers, neck and facial features.

Ameca's appearance features grey rubber skin on the face and hands, and is specifically designed to appear genderless.[12]

Application Guidelines
JENESYS Inbound Program
JENESYS2024 ASEAN – Japan Students Conference (Invitation Program)
1. Objective of program
JENESYS* is a people-to-people exchange program between Japan and the Asia-Pacific region
launched by the Japanese Government. JENESY consists of Inbound Program from Asia-Pacific region
and Outbound program to Asia-Pacific region, Online Exchange Program and Program for Alumni. The
program aims at promoting mutual trust and understanding among the peoples of Japan and the
Asia-Pacific region and building a basis for future friendship and cooperation. It also encourages an
understanding of Japan’s economy, society, history, diverse culture, politics and diplomatic relations.
*JENESYS: Japan-East Asia Network of Exchange for Students and Youths
The main objectives of the ASEAN-Japan Student Conference are for youth from ASEAN countries,
Timor-Leste, and Japan to deepen their knowledge of the relationship between Japan and the ASEAN
region, to realize their own abilities and potential, to foster social contributions through sharing
awareness of issues common to Asia, observation and experience, and exchanging opinions on
solving issues, and to strengthen the network of friendship and cooperation through mutual
recognition of cultural diversity and mutual understanding. At the student conference, participants
will take up issues common to the region, such as "maritime security and the rule of law," "energy
and climate change," and "education and cultural preservation," and will divide into groups to discuss
them and present their action plans at a report session on the final day. Before the student conference
begins, overseas young people will visit local cities to learn about Japan's efforts on these issues,
experience homestays, and, as goodwill ambassadors for Japan, spread the word about their studies
in Japan and the charms of Japan on social media and other platforms.
Outline of Thematic Group
1. Maritime security and the rule of law
Free, open and stable seas, supported by a maritime order based on the rule of law, are
essential for peace and prosperity in the international community as a whole. The principles of
the Charter of the United Nations, such as respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, the
peaceful settlements of disputes in accordance with international law, and renunciation of the
use of force, are becoming increasingly important. In light of the importance of free, open and
stable seas, we will deepen our knowledge of compliance with international law in the field of
maritime security, peaceful resolution of disputes, the current state of maritime security,
environmental protection and sustainable use of marine resources, and consider measures
and possibilities that should be taken together in Asia.
2. Climate change and energy:
Climate change and the natural disasters it brings are major issues all over the world, including
ASEAN and Japan. The Asian region is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change
and faces various natural disasters and environmental problems. On the other hand,
promoting sustainable energy policies is essential for the region's economic growth and
environmental protection. While promoting climate change measures, it is necessary to work
toward ensuring a stable supply of energy and reducing energy costs. Through the discussion,
we will understand international efforts to combat climate change, expand our knowledge of
joint strategies within the region and sustainable energy strategies, and consider measures
and possibilities that should be taken in Asia.
3. Education and cultural preservation
Cultural heritage plays an important role as something that has historical, social, and economic
value for each country and region. However, there are many cases where such cultural
heritage is at risk due to climate change, urbanization, and natural and man-made disasters.
We will learn about education to promote understanding of traditional cultures and regional
cultures, and about the technologies and efforts for protecting and preserving tangible and
intangible cultural heritage, and through discussion, we will consider how we should pass on
culture in the future.
