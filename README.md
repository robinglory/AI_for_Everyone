# üéì AI for Everyone: My Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal AI learning journal! This repository documents my progress through the *AI for Everyone* YouTube series by **Paul McWhorter**. Each lesson brings me closer to understanding Artificial Intelligence concepts, OpenCV, Python, and real-world applications of computer vision and machine learning. I‚Äôm excited to share my code, notes, and insights as I build projects and tackle each lesson‚Äôs challenges.

## About the Course

[AI for Everyone by Paul McWhorter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gD_HWj_hvbo&list=PLGs0VKk2DiYyXlbJVaE8y1qr24YldYNDm&pp=iAQB) is designed for absolute beginners who want to explore Artificial Intelligence in an approachable way. This series covers everything from setting up Python and OpenCV to building advanced projects like gesture recognition and pose estimation using Mediapipe. The course uses Python and OpenCV on a Windows 10 PC, and Paul also demonstrates each project using a Logitech webcam for consistent results.

> **Note**: Paul recommends the [Logitech webcam](https://amzn.to/3iwgIW0) he uses in the videos to follow along more easily.

## üìö Course Outline & My Progress

Below is the list of lessons and my progress. I'll keep updating this README as I complete each topic, along with links to specific code snippets, notes, or any reflections.

### Core Lessons and Topics

1. **[Lesson 1: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gD_HWj_hvbo)** - Overview of AI and goals for the series
2. **Lesson 2-4: Python Environment Setup** - Running multiple versions, virtual environments, and Visual Studio Code setup
3. **Lesson 5: Installing OpenCV** - First steps with OpenCV and webcam capture
   - üìù [My Code for Webcam Setup](link to your code file here)
4. **Lesson 6: Optimizing Webcam Performance in OpenCV**
5. **Lesson 7: Understanding Images as Data Arrays**
6. **Lesson 8: Drawing and Text on Images** - Creating overlays on images with OpenCV
7. **Lesson 9: Regions of Interest (ROI)**
8. **Lesson 10: Mouse Events in OpenCV**
9. **Lesson 11: Trackbars in OpenCV** - Control parameters interactively
10. **Lesson 12-13: HSV Color Space & Object Tracking by Color**
11. **Lesson 14: Contours and Shape Detection**
12. **Lesson 15-16: Face Detection and Recognition**
13. **Lesson 17-19: Mediapipe for Hand Detection and Pose Estimation**
14. **Lesson 20-23: Gesture Detection and Real-Time Tracking**
15. **Lesson 24-30: Advanced Gesture Recognition and Control**

Each of these milestones is a step toward mastering AI concepts and using OpenCV to solve real-world problems.

## üöÄ Goals and Personal Objectives

* Understand fundamental AI concepts.
* Gain practical experience in computer vision and image processing using OpenCV.
* Implement projects in Python to reinforce learning.
* Build a portfolio of small applications and code snippets for reference.
* Experiment with Mediapipe for gesture recognition and object tracking.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

* `Programs/`: Completed Python scripts for each lesson.

## üîÑ Updates & Reflections

- **Lesson 5 (Webcam Setup)** - Learned how to capture video from the webcam and display it in grayscale, HLS, and LAB color spaces. [Link to code](link to your code here)
- **Lesson 6 (Performance Tuning)** - Optimized webcam capture for smoother performance using OpenCV.
- **Lesson 10 (Mouse Events)** - Explored using mouse events to interact with images, which is especially useful for selecting regions or drawing on images.

*More reflections and code links will be added as I progress!*

*I might not add more progress or not it is based on my feeling. Sometimes, i feel lazy as hell :)*

## üèÜ Acknowledgements

A big thank you to **Paul McWhorter** for creating this excellent course and making AI accessible to everyone. This journey is just beginning, and I look forward to continuing to build and learn.
