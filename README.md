# üéì AI for Everyone: My Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal AI learning journal! This repository documents my progress through the **AI for Everyone** YouTube series by Paul McWhorter. Each lesson helps me understand Artificial Intelligence concepts, OpenCV, Python, and real-world applications of computer vision and machine learning. I‚Äôm sharing my code, notes, and insights as I complete each lesson.

## üìö Course Information
**Course Name:** AI for Everyone
**Instructor:** Paul McWhorter  
- [YouTube Course Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGs0VKk2DiYyXlbJVaE8y1qr24YldYNDm)  
- [Instructor‚Äôs Website](https://toptechboy.com/)  

This series covers everything from setting up Python and OpenCV to building advanced projects like gesture recognition and pose estimation using Mediapipe. The course is designed for beginners and uses OpenCV with Python.

# Python Programs Repository

## Overview
This repository contains various Python programs related to OpenCV, AI, and other projects. The main programs are derived from Paul McWhorter's AI for Everyone course, along with additional projects on face recognition, license plate detection, and sign language recognition.

## Additional Projects
- **Face Recognition**: Implementations for detecting and recognizing faces.
- **License Plate Detection**: Computer vision-based license plate recognition.
- **Sign Language Recognition**: Using AI to translate sign language gestures.
- **Hand Gesture-Based Game**: A simple game controlled with hand gestures.
- **OCR Python"** : A GUI chatbot powered by AI and OCR

---

## Installation
### Prerequisites:
1. Python 3.8+
2. Install required libraries:
   ```sh
   pip install opencv-python numpy mediapipe
   ```
3. (For AI models) Install additional dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install tensorflow torch torchvision
   ```

---

## Usage
Run the scripts as follows:
```sh
python opencv-1.py  # Example for OpenCV lesson 1
python facerecoginitionFamily.py  # Face recognition example
python licenceplatedetection.py  # License plate detection
```

---

## Notes
- The OpenCV lessons are structured to follow **Paul McWhorter's** AI for Everyone series.
- The **SignLanguage** and **MyanmarChatGPT** projects require additional configurations (see their respective folders).
