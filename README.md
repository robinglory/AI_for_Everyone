# üéì AI for Everyone: My Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal AI learning journal! This repository documents my progress through the **AI for Everyone** YouTube series by Paul McWhorter. Each lesson helps me understand Artificial Intelligence concepts, OpenCV, Python, and real-world applications of computer vision and machine learning. I‚Äôm sharing my code, notes, and insights as I complete each lesson.

## üìö Course Information
**Course Name:** AI for Everyone
**Instructor:** Paul McWhorter  
- [YouTube Course Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGs0VKk2DiYyXlbJVaE8y1qr24YldYNDm)  
- [Instructor‚Äôs Website](https://toptechboy.com/)  

This series covers everything from setting up Python and OpenCV to building advanced projects like gesture recognition and pose estimation using Mediapipe. The course is designed for beginners and uses OpenCV with Python.

## üìÅ Repository Structure
This repository primarily contains Python scripts corresponding to lessons from the AI for Everyone series. The naming convention follows the lesson numbers, e.g.:

```
opencv-1.py      # Lesson 1
opencv-2.py      # Lesson 2
...
opencv-10.py     # Lesson 10
...
opencv-37.py     # Super Fast Face Detection Using Mediapipe
opencv-38.py     # Parsing Mediapipe Pose, Face, and Hand Landmarks
opencv-39.py     # Mediapipe Facemesh
opencv-40.py     # Understanding the Data Structure of Mediapipe
```

Any additional code related to the course, such as homework, follows the same pattern (e.g., `opencv-5-homework.py` for Lesson 5 Homework).

### Other Projects (Not Part of the Course)
This repository also includes unrelated AI and OpenCV projects that I have experimented with:
- **Face Recognition Projects**
  - `facerecognitionFamily.py`  
  - `familyfacerecognition.py`
- **License Plate Detection**
  - `licenceplatedetection.py`
  - `LicencePlateDetection2.py`
- **Hand Gesture & Mediapipe Projects**
  - `handgesture_pingponggame.py`  
  - `mediapipe_facemesh.py`
- **OCR & AI Chatbots**
  - `OCR Python`
  - `pdf_txt_ai_chatbot`

## üöÄ Course Progress & Notes
I will update my progress and notes for each lesson as I complete them.
